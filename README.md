Meedan is a global technology not-for-profit that builds software and programmatic initiatives to strengthen journalism, digital literacy, and accessibility of information online and off.

We develop open-source tools for creating and sharing context on digital media through annotation, verification, archival, and translation.

We work with technologists, newsrooms, fact-checkers, public health professionals, NGOs and academic institutions on award-winning projects from election monitoring to pandemic response to human rights documentation. This work supports our vision of a more equitable internet.

Meedan’s seven core values reflect our operating principles, organizational culture and best practices as a team.

##OUR WORK

We believe that creating a more equitable internet requires an interdisciplinary approach across multiple forms of intersecting activities. Meedan’s five core pillars of work include technology development, network building, strategic training, collaborative and ethical data collection, and rigorous research. These pillars are inherently evolutionary and responsive.

##01). Technology development


Improved open-access tools and technical infrastructure for independent actors to curate, check, verify and debunk claims, links and media shared online.


##02). Network building


Improved collaboration and stronger networks between independent media, journalism programs and journalists, activists, archivists and human rights defenders working on open source investigation, fact checking, verification, digital media literacy efforts, and access to correct and credible health information.


##03). Strategic and training


Improved capacity of journalism students, citizen journalists, civil society and activist networks and human rights documentation enthusiasts to verify content, conduct investigations and debunk false claims and misinformation, and to produce viable online content to counter the rise of mis-information in their countries



##04). Data collection and analysis


Improved data infrastructure and provision to support efficient workflow and effective dissemination via platforms.


##05). Rigorous research


Improved understanding of the relation between open-source tech development and social impact, as well as the global misinformation ecosystem on ways in which citizens' public opinion is formed, and optimal approaches for addressing content-specific misinformation such as health misinformation.
